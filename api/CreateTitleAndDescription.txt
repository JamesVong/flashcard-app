User Input: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion Sort works best for small or mostly sorted arrays and has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. However, it is stable and works in-place, making it a good choice for small datasets.

Output:
Title: Insertion Sort Algorithm

Description: Covers the fundamentals of Insertion Sort, including its operation, efficiency, and use cases. Compares Insertion Sort with other sorting algorithms and discusses its advantages for small datasets.
